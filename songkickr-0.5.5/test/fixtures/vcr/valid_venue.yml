        situated in the heart of Brixton, South London. The venue has played host
        to many notable shows and reunions, welcoming a wide variety of artists, from
        Bob Dylan to Eminem, to the stage. It attracts over half a million visitors
        per year, accommodating over one hundred events.\n\nBuilt in 1929, the site
        started life as one of the four state of the art\n Astoria Theaters, screening
        a variety of motion pictures and shows. In 1972 the venue was transformed
        into a rock venue and re-branded as The Sundown Centre. With limited success
        the venue closed it''s doors in 1974 and was not re-opened as a music venue
        again until 1983, when it became The Brixton Academy.\n\nFeaturing a beautiful
        Art Deco interior, the venue is now known as the 02 Academy Brixton, and hosts
        a diverse range of club nights and live performances, as well as seated events.
        The venue has an upstairs balcony as well as the main floor downstairs. There
        is disabled access and facilities, a bar and a cloakroom. Club night events
        are for over 18s, for live music under 14s must be accompanied by an adult.","capacity":4921,"city":{"displayName":"London","uri":"http://www.songkick.com/metro_areas/24426-uk-london?utm_source=4791&utm_medium=partner","id":24426,"country":{"displayName":"UK"}},"metroArea":{"displayName":"London","uri":"http://www.songkick.com/metro_areas/24426-uk-london?utm_source=4791&utm_medium=partner","id":24426,"country":{"displayName":"UK"}},"lat":51.4651204,"uri":"http://www.songkick.com/venues/17522-o2-academy-brixton?utm_source=4791&utm_medium=partner","lng":-0.1148897,"id":17522}}}}'
